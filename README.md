TODO:

- [X] Communication (broadcast info) // we'll just ask bondsman/grab bondsman object
- [X] Statistics 
- [ ] Jumpship mechanism to take care of the different consequences
- [ ] Experiement scenarios like rotating the agents' home base and measuring how long they take to adapt
- [ ] Learning Algorithms
  - [ ] Q(<task, agent type>) (state takes other agents into account not just the task) and a better update function
  - [ ] Use a leader board and then incorporate the statistics into the learning

- [x] Set up the agent's for the experiment in each of the corners

- [x] Teleport agent back to its corner once the agent has reached the task.  (considering making a delay before the task is regenerated)
