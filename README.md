TODO:

- [X] Communication (broadcast info) // we'll just ask bondsman/grab bondsman object
- [X] Statistics 
- [X] Jumpship mechanism to take care of the different consequences.  Use the bondsman.  Tell the bondsman that you are jumping ship.  (pass yourself)
  - [ ] Penalty to jumpship
  - [ ] Start over if jumpship
  - [ ] Once you commit then that is the bounty you get if you jumpship and come back to it.
  - [ ] Can't jumpship if no one else is working on the task
- [ ] Experiement scenarios like rotating the agents' home base and measuring how long they take to adapt
- [ ] Learning Algorithms
  - [ ] Q(<task, agent type>) (state takes other agents into account not just the task) and a better update function
  - [ ] Use a leader board and then incorporate the statistics into the learning

- [x] Set up the agent's for the experiment in each of the corners

- [x] Teleport agent back to its corner once the agent has reached the task.  (considering making a delay before the task is regenerated)
